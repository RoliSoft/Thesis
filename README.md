This repository contains the rewrite of my bachelor's thesis for the purposes of the XVII. Scientific Student Conference. Its official title is "Behatolástesztelő és Sebezhetőségfelderítő Rendszer." (Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment System)

The document is in Hungarian, since the organizers refused to accept English papers. Ehm. It's cool. It's not like I had 40 pages already written of it in the master branch in English anyways.<sup>/s</sup>

Since this version is not planned to be as detailed as the English version, nor will it be updated after the conference, I suggest you read the document in the [master branch](https://github.com/RoliSoft/Thesis/tree/master) if it interests you.
