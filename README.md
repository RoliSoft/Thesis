# Thesis

This repository contains my bachelor's thesis in L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X. Its official work-in-progress title is "Black-Box Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Management Platform."

The thesis talks about the implementation details of the application found in the [Host-Scanner](https://github.com/RoliSoft/Host-Scanner) repository, plus the various related scripts in the [Host-Scanner-Scripts](https://github.com/RoliSoft/Host-Scanner-Scripts) repository.
